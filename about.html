    <h2>About Langui</h2>
    <p>
        Langui was inspired by the desire to bridge communication gaps across different cultures and languages. As a developer, my passion for language learning and technology motivated me to create a real-time translation tool that could help people connect, no matter their native language.

        This project was developed as part of my portfolio project at <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com">Holberton School</a>, where I honed my skills in web development and programming.
